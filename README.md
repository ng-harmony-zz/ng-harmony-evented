![Harmony = 6 + 7;](src/logo.png "Harmony - Fire in my eyes")

## Synopsis

Will battle test first, then come up with a proper README and examples

## Code Example

```javascript
import { Controller, Service } from "ng-harmony/ng-harmony";
import { SomeUtilityClass, OtherUtilityClass} from "my-org/my-repo";
```

We can use this lib in such a way *[...]*

```javascript
class YourThingy extends Controller.mixin(SomeUtilityClass, OtherUtilityClass) {
```

## Motivation

* I wanted to be part of this because I liked it
* I am a secret agent and want to test my superpowers
* I had this idea ...
* I want to stick with Angular 1 for now and missed this feature

## Installation

I recommend the usage of jspm.
This way, just base your project upon jspm and start using this lib as in the code example above.

```bash
jspm i github:ng-harmony/...
```
